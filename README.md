# Bidirectional Communication System with Python's Socket Library

This repository contains a simple implementation of a bidirectional communication system using Python's socket module. The system consists of a server and a client that can send and receive messages to and from each other.

## Files

- **server.py**: This file contains the server-side code. It establishes a socket connection, listens for incoming messages, and sends responses.
- **client.py**: This file contains the client-side code. It connects to the server, sends messages, and receives responses.
- **README.md**: You are currently reading this file.

## Usage

1. Clone the repository:

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/KIRUBAKARAN-A/bidirectional-communication.git
   ```

2. Run the server:

   ```bash
   python server.py
   ```

3. Run the client:

   ```bash
   python client.py
   ```

4. Enter messages in the client console to send them to the server. The server will print the received messages and respond accordingly.

5. Messages sent from the server to the client will be displayed in the client console.

6. To exit, type "bye" in the client console.

## Note

- Ensure that you have Python installed on your system.

Feel free to explore and modify the code as needed for your projects! If you have any questions or suggestions, please [create an issue](https://github.com/KIRUBAKARAN-A/bidirectional-communication/issues) in this repository.
